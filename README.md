# Introduction to ColdLight

ColdLight is a Markdown based CFML documentation application. It was designed to allow instant preview of edited pages in large document sets without rebuilding.

It uses a simple format for describing the contents of a document and can be used either as a CFML app in "live" preview or to generate static HTML.
