# Using ColdLight

To use ColdLight, you first parse your publication into a variable, manipulate it if required, and then export using one or more of the format functions.

You can also create a live "preview" site that will reload individual pages when they change, speeding the review process.

<div href="livepreview.md" />
<div href="plugins.md" />
