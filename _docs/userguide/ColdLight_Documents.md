# ColdLight Publications

A ColdLight publication is specified via a "toc" file, which includes simple markdown, e.g.

```
[](gettingstarted)
[](coldLightmarkdown)
[](ColdLight_Documents)
[](coldlightdata)
[](pageObj)
[](fuzzy)
```

Each entry links to one markdown file with a single h1 tag. The order determines the order in which the entries appear in the menu.

You can also create an index file in the same folder name index.md. You don't have to do this and the first entry in the list will be used if not specified.

The toc links can be relative to the toc folder specified for the toc file.
