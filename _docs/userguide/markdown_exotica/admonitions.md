# Admonitions

Apply styling to a side element with the admonition syntax. This is three   `!` or `?` characters followed by the block class and then a title.

The text is indented after the title line. 

```
 note "Title"
    Block style with class and title  

??? note
    Collapse block style

???+ note
    Collapse block style open by default
```

Using `???` creates a collapsible block in the website version.

??? note
    Collapse block style
