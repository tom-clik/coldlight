# Introduction to ColdLight

ColdLight is a Markdown based CFML documentation application. 

It builds single document objects from a collection of documents with automatic cross referencing.

These can be used to create single HTML files for conversion to PDF or ePUB documents.

For static site generation, it is designed to integrate with Clikpage for full site creation.
