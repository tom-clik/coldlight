# Introduction to ColdLight

ColdLight is a Markdown based CFML documentation application. It was designed to allow instant preview of edited pages in large document sets without rebuilding.

It builds HTML from a collection of documents with automatic cross referencing.

It also builds data objects that can be used to construct data sets for Clikpage or your own web application.
