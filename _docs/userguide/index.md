ColdLight is a Markdown based documentation application written in CFML. 

It builds a single "publication" from a collection of markdown documents, which can be output as a single HTML file (for conversion to PDF), EPUB, or static website.

For static site generation, it uses a Mustache template to render the files. Some samples and themes are available in the repository.

As a CFML application, it is easily extensible to add custom content. The documents are JSOUP nodes, and can easily be manipulated with a JQuery like syntax.
