# Introduction to ColdLight

ColdLight is a Markdown based CFML documentation application. 

It builds a single "publication" from a collection of markdown documents, which can be output as a single HTML file (for conversion to PDF), EPUB, or static website.



These can be used to create single HTML files for conversion to PDF or ePUB documents.

For static site generation, it is designed to integrate with Clikpage for full site creation.
