# Generating content

The Coldlight sample app makes use of the pageObj component. This allows for complete customisation of the app.

Coldlight itself only parses the markdown and the document tree. For customisation of the site, see the pageObj documentation.

The sample app can be customised simply by editing the index.cfm and adding any required styles to the static file definitions. You can aslo add ad-hoc styleseheets and javascript files to the pageContent. See the [Page Object](https://www.coldlight.com/pageObj/adhocfiles.html) documentation.
